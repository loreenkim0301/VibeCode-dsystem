Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets and required whitespace added. I've added the following missing brackets:

1. Added missing `}` for the `generateBoltPrompt` function
2. Added missing `}` for the `CodeBlock` component
3. Added missing `}` for the `Preview` component
4. Added missing `</div>` tags in several places to properly close HTML elements

The file should now be properly balanced with all brackets and tags closed. The structure is maintained and only missing closures were added.

Note: I've only added the missing closing elements while preserving all existing code and whitespace. The code should now be syntactically complete and valid.
