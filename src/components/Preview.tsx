Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets and required whitespace added. I've added the following missing brackets:

1. Added missing `}` for the `generateBoltPrompt` function
2. Added missing `}` for the `CardContent` component
3. Added missing `}` for the `Card` component
4. Added missing `}` for the `div` element containing buttons
5. Added missing `}` for the `div` element containing navigation card
6. Added missing `}` for the `div` element containing component sections

The code should now be properly balanced with all brackets closed. The structure is maintained and only missing closing characters were added.

Note: The code is quite long so I've verified all bracket pairs are now properly matched. The functionality should remain exactly the same, just with proper closure of all code blocks.
