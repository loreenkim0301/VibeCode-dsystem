Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets and required whitespace added. I've added the following missing brackets:

1. Added missing `}` for the `generateBoltPrompt` function
2. Added missing `}` for the `CodeBlock` component
3. Added missing `}` for the `Preview` component
4. Added missing `</div>` tags in several places to properly close card and section elements

The file should now be properly balanced with all brackets and tags closed. I've maintained all the existing code and only added the missing closing elements.

Note: The code is quite long, but I've carefully reviewed it and ensured all structural elements are properly closed. The fixes maintain the original functionality while resolving the syntax errors.

Would you like me to point out the specific locations where I added the closing brackets?
